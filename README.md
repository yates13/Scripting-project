## Automating Routine Data Visualization - Python Scripting Project

### Shawn Yates and Rachel Haich
 
Our current lab practices use excel and graphpad for visualization of large amounts of data. This is sufficient for small experiments, but is time consuming, particularly for large
 experiments. Additionally, graphpad is not open source and requires an annual subscription. For this project, we propose a few automated python scripts to process and visualize our results from excel datasheets into easily interpretted graphics.

The first main target for automation in our lab are cell death assays, which measure the rate of cell death in response to a treatment. The output of this test is a standardized excel template which can be used as the basis of our script. The second target is our viral growth curves. This requires manual input of viral titer counts, which we will standardize in order to make a script feasible. We intend to write a python script for each case which quickly processes the data and presents it in an easy to read, publishable format while reducing the possiblity of user error during visualization.
